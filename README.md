## Automatic location detection
To accurately determine the weather data, it is necessary to know the location with accuracy to the area. The IP address definition is used for this purpose. After the first change of the settings, the location specified by the user in the City field will be applied. To start the default location detection and reset all settings, you can delete the ```settings.json``` file.
